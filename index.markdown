Welcome ðŸ¥³! I have just completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at TU Berlin with a focus on cognitive systems. I'm interested in studying and developing machine learning systems that are efficient, general and adaptive.
In my free time I like to read, play badminton and watch [professional League of Legends](https://lolesports.com/).
